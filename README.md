## Features
- As the name suggests, this project is an information management application. The main functionality is achieved by using JDBC to interact with MySQL and perform CRUD operations.
- In this system, we have defined two roles: employee and boss (administrator), each with different usage scenarios:
  - Employees can manage warehouse information.
  - The boss can manage both employee and warehouse information.

- This project displays menus and information in the console using character-based output. It allows users to interact by inputting specific keys to perform data management operations, which is more user-friendly compared to pure code-based operations.
